# sign-language
Here are some key points   :

- Implemented CNN models like custom CNN, VGG16, EfficientNet, etc. for multi-class classification of sign language gestures from image dataset.

- Achieved over 90% accuracy on test set for some models through hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

- Performed data loading, preprocessing, augmentation and applied train-test split for robust evaluation. 

- Leveraged techniques like transfer learning, GlobalAveragePooling, dropout, etc. to improve model generalization.

- Compared performance of different CNN architectures and machine learning models like SVM, KNN on same dataset.

- Added model explainability by plotting confusion matrix, classification report to identify successes and areas of improvement.

- Demonstrated end-to-end ML workflow from data preparation to model development and evaluation.

- Applied deep learning and computer vision techniques for an image classification task with real-world applications.

- Developed models that can recognize sign language gestures, enabling communication applications.

- Implemented in Python using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas.

- Modularized code into functions for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation etc.
